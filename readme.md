A Scuba Diving Calculator for Air Dives.

I have written this application on Rails as a single page app. I used twitter bootstrap to get the page styled and responsive, and well, because I wanted to learn bootstap.

Some other features are:
*an -onclick listener to start the calculations when the user clicks the calculate button.
*reads values from text boxes in JS to provide data for the calculations then writes the results of the calculations into the results area of the sheet.
*controlller specific Javascript comes from .coffee files so that when you load one sheet the event listeners of another sheet do not report "cannot add event listener of null"
